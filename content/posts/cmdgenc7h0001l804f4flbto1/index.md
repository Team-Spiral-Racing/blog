## Planning
It didn't take long for us to plan this. Ever since I had my S2000, I had always intended to track it a lot. I just didn't really have time up to this point due to being in Europe for a business trip for 3 months. I had previously gone to this track on the CCW configuration but this time would be a CW. My brothers friends had reached out to us if we wanted to go. They already had a decently large size group so we planned on splitting up till the day of.

## Leading Up
That Thursday night, I flew back from San Jose (business trip) and began packing all of the equipment needed. Friday morning, I left for Riverside with various equipment in the S2000 including a jack, jack stands, an e-scooter, a whole bunch of miscellaneous stuff. You would be surprised by how much you can fit inside of an S2000. After arriving, I worked remotely till the end of the day.
On Saturday, we made final preparations, grabbed some dinner with friends and rested well for our drive up.

## Morning
At 5:00 AM, we woke up and got ready. We headed out around 5:30 in the S2000 and the Accord. On the way, we grabbed some ice for the drinks that we were bringing up. We then traveled North until we reached Palmdale where we grabbed some McDonald's for breakfast. By 8:00 AM we had reached Willow Springs. It was an uneventful drive up but was great to see the sun rise over the plains.

## Early Track
We did our driver's meeting and had an enjoyable morning at the track. Met a lot of good friends during this time. Here are some pictures from the morning:

## Lunch
We started getting hungry as lunch approached and grabbed lunch at [Guido's @ The Hanger](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5q8Gd1UXtybFkE577) which was a sort of almost Italian style restaurant. Food was good but a heavy and a little on the pricier side.

Some of the guys were in advanced group and decided to head out first. We stayed back for a little bit longer to enjoy the meal.

## Afternoon Track
The track started getting quite hot during the afternoon and times weren't improving. We did have fun going out for some laps but it wasn't going for PBs anymore. At this time, I had the opportunity to drive a 350 WHP FK8 CTR which was quite a surreal experience. After a warmup lap, I immediately set a 1:30.803 before it started overheating. I took it up for a slow cruise around the pits to cool it down and that was the end up that. At the end of the day, we did a line up in front of the Streets sign and took some pictures. One of them is the splash on "Our Team".

## Dinner
Although we were tired, we decided to grab dinner on the way back.  We went to [One Bite Dumpling一口香饺子坊](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NiPqnNidZcfm2C5u7) which was great after a long day. On the way back to Riverside, there was a pretty nasty crash so stay safe out there.

## Conclusion
Overall a really fun track day trip. Probably the most enjoyable track day I've ever had the pleasure of doing and would love to go with a big group again.
