The high revving engine and light weight car was an unbeatable combination. At this point, my brother had already done some laps in mine at a track day so he was keen on picking up his own soon. And so, he started looking.\nOn October 15th, 2024 my brother sent me a listing for a 2006 Berlina Black S2000. It looked like a great deal but the only caveat was that it was in Michigan. After setting up a call with the owner, we checked for and found no rust. In addition, we did our due diligence and figured that this was a pretty good deal. Pretty soon, we were preparing for a trip to Michigan.\nFlying Over # I had recently graduated from college and my parents had given me a $500 Southwest Airlines gift card. I was originally planning on getting a job in the Bay Area and they had intended for it to cover my fare. However, this would instead serve as a ticket for both me and my brother to fly out of Ontario (ONT) to Las Vegas (LAS) for a quick 1 hour layover. We would then fly from Las Vegas to Tulsa (TUL) where we would meet the seller. He had taken the liberty of making the hour and half drive from Missouri to Tulsa in order to make this sale.\nLooking at the S2000 # After landing, we waited for about 20 minutes before he arrived. He showed us around the car and we took it for a test drive around the airport. One of the things we noticed was that the clutch was on its way out and had a pretty high bite point. We also confirmed that the CEL light was on due to catalytic convertor with my OBD2 scanner. We were pretty happy with the car but were able to negotiate the price down to 17k. After signing the paperwork, we were on our way home.\nWe also noticed it did have a small tear in the softop. This would eventually become massive throughout our trip becoming a massive headache with all of the wind noise. We did try to patch it with duck tape but only had limited success.\nHeading Home # There was no easy way back, we had a roughly 20 hour drive under ideal conditions. Since we had two drivers, we didn\u0026rsquo;t plan on getting a place to stay at overnight and just raw dog it back to Riverside. We were getting hungry so we decided to grab some local fast food in the form of Charlie\u0026rsquo;s Chicken.\nHonestly the food wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad and it was cheap (compared to California prices). It served as good fuel for us to go on despite being on the heavier side. Speaking of fuel, it was amazing to see such cheap gas prices. We got a receipt from a Costco gas which served as a bit of a souvenir.\nAfter our fuel up, we started to begin our long drive east. After some time, we made it into Amarillo, Texas where we picked up some gas and dinner. This was the first time my brother and I had grabbed some Del Taco and found it pretty good. Although quite a bit messy, we enjoyed it and would try it again. We made a quick stop at a Rite Aid to clean up a bit and decided that it was a good time to head out.\nWe steadily made our way east throughout the evening. Due to some road closures, we had to make a couple of detours but overall conditions it was good. We were able to enjoy a sunset as it turned to night.\nGrand Canyon # Things were good until about midnight when we just crossed into New Mexico. A massive shower hit us and we had to slow to 40mph where even semi trucks were passing us. We focused on keeping the car on the road for about 30 minutes where we eventually made it out of the storm. We continued driving until about 4 AM where we pulled over to rest for a bit.\nAt about 7 in the morning, we made it to Flagstaff, Arizona. Since it was on the way, we checked out the Grand Canyon. To get there, we headed up via the scenic Route 180. At the time it was snowing and we experienced an enjoyable drive through the winter wonderland. This was quite surprising considering we were in Arizona of all places but was quite welcome. Per usual, the Grand Canyon was a great sight to see.\nAfter our detour, we got back on the road. During lunch time, we stopped by Kingman to try Culver\u0026rsquo;s. A friend of mine had highly suggested it so we decided to give it a try. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad but I would pick In-n-Out over it any day. After our lunch, our lack of rest began piling up. You can see the exhaustion on my brother\u0026rsquo;s face in the picture. At this point, we had both done around 8 hours of driving. However, since we were close to the finish line, we decided to keep pushing.\nAfter some time, we eventually made it back into California. We still had another couple of hours to go but it was truly the final stretch. Our route had us drive through Joshua Tree National Park and past Chuckwalla Raceway. Someday, the same car we were currently in would eventually go to that track.\nAt 6PM, we had finally arrived at my brother\u0026rsquo;s place in Riverside. We had left for the airport on Saturday October 19th at 4:30 AM and had finally arrived back in Riverside at 6 PM. We had each driven 11 hours for a total of a 22 hour drive. After much adventure and exhaustion, the BBS2K had finally arrived home.\nConclusion # So, what did this trip net us? We had paid 17K for the S2000 and about 600 dollars for the flight tickets to Tulsa. I estimate about 300 dollars for food and gas heading back as well. Overall, it was a lot of Type 2 fun. The seats were worn so it was uncomfortable to sit, the softop was torn so lots of wind noise, and the clutch was rough so it was hard to drive. However, I would do this again in a heartbeat\u0026hellip;for a great deal on an S2000.\n","date":"23 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cmdg2euyp0001ky04ky55a1ic/","section":"Posts","summary":"Speed on the Horizon My brother has always wanted an S2000 after getting mine.

Ever since I had my S2000, I had always intended to track it a lot. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t really have time up to this point due to being in Europe for a business trip for 3 months. I had previously gone to this track on the CCW configuration but this time would be a CW. My brothers friends had reached out to us if we wanted to go. They already had a decently large size group so we planned on splitting up till the day of.\nLeading Up # That Thursday night, I flew back from San Jose (business trip) and began packing all of the equipment needed. Friday morning, I left for Riverside with various equipment in the S2000 including a jack, jack stands, an e-scooter, a whole bunch of miscellaneous stuff. You would be surprised by how much you can fit inside of an S2000. After arriving, I worked remotely till the end of the day. On Saturday, we made final preparations, grabbed some dinner with friends and rested well for our drive up.\nMorning # At 5:00 AM, we woke up and got ready. We headed out around 5:30 in the S2000 and the Accord. On the way, we grabbed some ice for the drinks that we were bringing up. We then traveled North until we reached Palmdale where we grabbed some McDonald\u0026rsquo;s for breakfast. By 8:00 AM we had reached Willow Springs. It was an uneventful drive up but was great to see the sun rise over the plains.\nEarly Track # We did our driver\u0026rsquo;s meeting and had an enjoyable morning at the track. Met a lot of good friends during this time. Here are some pictures from the morning: Lunch # We started getting hungry as lunch approached and grabbed lunch at Guido\u0026rsquo;s @ The Hanger which was a sort of almost Italian style restaurant. Food was good but a heavy and a little on the pricier side. Some of the guys were in advanced group and decided to head out first. We stayed back for a little bit longer to enjoy the meal.\nAfternoon Track # The track started getting quite hot during the afternoon and times weren\u0026rsquo;t improving. We did have fun going out for some laps but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t going for PBs anymore. At this time, I had the opportunity to drive a 350 WHP FK8 CTR which was quite a surreal experience. After a warmup lap, I immediately set a 1:30.803 before it started overheating. I took it up for a slow cruise around the pits to cool it down and that was the end up that. At the end of the day, we did a line up in front of the Streets sign and took some pictures. One of them is the splash on \u0026ldquo;Our Team\u0026rdquo;. Dinner # Although we were tired, we decided to grab dinner on the way back. We went to One Bite Dumpling一口香饺子坊 which was great after a long day. On the way back to Riverside, there was a pretty nasty crash so stay safe out there. Conclusion # Overall a really fun track day trip. Probably the most enjoyable track day I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of doing and would love to go with a big group again.\n","date":"23 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cmdgenc7h0001l804f4flbto1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Planning It didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for us to plan this.
