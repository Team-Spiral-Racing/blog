However, with grad school coming up it was hard to justify spend 15k+ on a depreciating asset. However, while waiting for a table at Hako we threw around the idea of a project car. It would help him and I pick up some mechanical knowledge, and would provide as some extracurricular bonus for his Mechanical Engineer Grad journey. For the next couple of weeks, we went through listings. We laid some ground rules:\n4k limit Nothing Euro Ideally something from Honda Salvage/Rebuilt titles OK After throwing around a few listings, our first candidate was an RSX swapped with all the stuff to make it a Type-S for . This listing looked pretty good so we scheduled some time to see it in person in La Mesa. After running the codes, it did have throttle position center issue which wasn\u0026rsquo;t a bad fix. However after taking it for a test drive, it was pretty jumpy which put us off a little bit so we decided to let it go.\nOur next option was the B20 Civic. After some talks with the seller, it looked pretty good to us so we planned to head up.\nTaking a Look at Greatness # Since it was pretty good, we decided to head the next day, being a Wednesday. The day of, Justin went into work extremely early (~5:30 AM) to get out early. I had the privilege of working hybrid so I just dropped by the office for an two hours and left at 12 PM. By 1 PM, I had everything ready and we were ready to head up in my Accord. Since we were trying to snag it before anyone else did, we took the toll roads up. It was a nice experience but having multiple companies manage different toll roads is a pain in the ass. I got hit with a $20 late fee on a $6 toll which is unreal.\nWe pushed through the rush hour traffic and made it to Shadow Hills/Burbank area by 4:30 PM. Three and a half hours of driving, we were hoping to come back with the car. After waiting a bit, the seller came. After a quick test drive, I confirmed what I saw. A piece of shit, but really fun.\nThis 98\u0026rsquo; Civic DX was B20 swapped. It was obnoxiously loud, smelled a bit like gas, and was pretty slow but flooring it in first to second turned me silly. It was also stupidly low, and the rear wheels had more negative camber than the front but that was a problem we could fix.\nWe handed over the money, wrote $1k on the bill of sale and title, and the deal was done. It was Justin\u0026rsquo;s first time nabbing a car like this so he was pretty stunned soaking in the moment. I took Justin around the block for a quick rip then chilled for a bit while calling my brother showing him the car. It started to get late, and we started to get hungry. Justin recommended Tacos 1986 and we headed over for dinner. Overall pretty good food place, though it can get expensive fast.\nHeading Home # Satisfied with our dinner, we set off back home. It was looking like a 2 hour drive home and the car was running low so stopped by Costco for some gas and got ready to head down.\nThe ride home was uncomfortable. I had experience making some seriously long drives previously but this was particularly draining with the loud exhaust, slight smell of gas, one working speaker, and poor ride quality. My phone had died part way through the drive so I was relying on Justin in my Accord leading the way, though it was pretty simple once we were on the I-5.\nAlthough tiring, the ride was sort of ethereal. Dusk faded to night as we drove past some familiar sites: the Kia dealership, Spectrum Center, etc. We finally made it home at around 10 PM and were ready to close the day out. Aftermath # Over the next few weeks, we started fixing up the car. We knocked out:\nSagging bumper Missing bolts Rotate tires Oil change The goal for the car is for it to be pretty functional going forward. The intent is to eventually take the Civic to the track but we are concerned about the reliability of it.\nFirst Shakedown # Justin was vacationing in Asia for some weeks and I decided to have some fun of my own by shaking the car down on Palomar Mountain. Ripping it up South Grade felt good. The gearing was just right and the power felt adequate. I reached the top and pulled into Palomar Mt. General Store to relax for a bit. After some time, I hit East Grade downhill. It was a bit sketchy and the car didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the higher speed stuff. For my full experience checkout the video below:\nAfter reaching the pull off point, I pulled in and made a rookie mistake by putting on the handbrake. It took maybe 10s for my brain to run again and I immediately put it down and put the car into gear. However, the damage was done. I got out of the car and the front right was smoke a bit. The DOT3 (I assume) fluid was for sure boiled up. I waited a bit and tried to give it a shot but the brakes were done.\nAfter waiting for about an hour and a half and contemplating if I should call a tow, the car self bled itself just a little bit that 100% of the brake would enact ~25% of the braking force. I figured it would be good enough so I took off and limped it home using mainly engine braking to slow and brakes to stop.\nJustin did eventually get back from Asia and over a weekend, we did the following to the car:\nReplace lugs Raise car ride height Reduce negative camber in the rear Bled and replaced brake fluid with DOT4 ATE200 A quick spin around the neighborhood and we confirmed it was good to go. Second Shakedown # After some time, I decided it would be good for a second shakedown at Palomar Mountain. This time I went with my brother who took his S2000. We figured out a couple of things.\nThe Civc is realy, really slow. Full throttle in 2nd/3rd in the civic was about equivalent to an AP2 F22C 4th at 50% throttle. It needs new tires. Cornering speed is extremely slow and I even locked up going down East Grade. You can see it in one of the videos. Despite all that, it was enjoyable. The gearing on South Grade and rips from the first shakedown were not illusions and was a blast. For the full experience check out the videos on YouTube.\nPlanned Stuff # With all of our experience with the car, we eventually want to do the following to the car to make it easier to work on and more reliable:\nSwap out the rear drum brakes for disks Swap front disks to something bigger (Mini cooper?) New tires (Kuhmo V730 👀) Shifter rebuild As previously mentioned, the goal is eventually to take this to the track for some of the harder stuff. The car isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, and likely never will be, but we will enjoy it as much as we can for now.\n","date":"24 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cmdgscsc60001s44s2qeup6ej/","section":"Posts","summary":"Beginnings My friend Justin, like me, has always wanted an AP2 S2000.

That’s where two-way radios (or walkie talkies) come in. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s calling out road hazards, coordinating pit stops, or just sharing the moment, radios keep everyone connected when mobile data disappears.\nCar enthusiasts using radios isn\u0026rsquo;t a new concept, its been in the car scene for quite awhile whether just for simple communication, spotters to flag cars coming down, or even reporting of police. Its utility is unmatched in areas where you can\u0026rsquo;t get a signal with your phone and is easy to use when try to keep focused on the road. Some disadvantages, however, are lack of privacy, range, and additional cost. Despite this, its advantages outweigh its benefits so I decided to get one (or four).\nPicking a Radio # When picking a radio, there are essentially four main \u0026ldquo;protocols\u0026rdquo; that it uses: FRS, CB, GMRS, and HAM. This is primarily for FM radio (better than AM).\nFamily Radio Service (FRS) # FRS radios are often what people imaging when they say \u0026ldquo;walkie talkie\u0026rdquo;. They are generally sold as pairs (bubble packs) and have low power and range transmissions. Not ideal for usage in a car, especially if there is range, trees, or elevation in the way. Car enthusiasts do use these however. However, you pretty much have to be right next to, or behind each other for these. For these reasons, a no go for me.\nCitizen Band (CB) # CB radio has its roots in truckers. Many truckers will have one in their trucks to communicate with others. Popular frequencies are Channel 9 for emergencies and Channel 19 for highway communication. In addition to this, car enthusiasts have been using CB radio for a long time. It\u0026rsquo;s wide range means talking to others is easy and as long as you have relatively OK line of sight communication isn\u0026rsquo;t that spotty. The most common usage I\u0026rsquo;ve seen with car enthusiasts is running in canyons where they can get a decent signal.\nThis seemed like the obvious choice but CB radio does have a few downsides. First while the range is large, the quality of sound isn\u0026rsquo;t great. Even if you receive a transmission, it can sound distorted. That\u0026rsquo;s why truckers with their height and long highways with great line of sight can use them. The second is that the antenna needed to run CB radio is ridiculously long and looks quite silly despite being functional. For me, these two reasons were enough to put me off a bit to look for something better.\nGeneral Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) # GMRS radios offer a solid balance between power, range, and sound quality. They operate on similar frequencies to FRS, but with much higher output power, up to 50 watts for mobile units. That power boost makes a big difference, especially in mountainous or forested terrain where signal strength matters. GMRS radios also tend to offer better voice clarity than CB, and the antennas are much more manageable in size, especially if you go with a mobile unit mounted in your car.\nOne of the best things about GMRS is its compatibility with repeaters. If you\u0026rsquo;re in an area with a repeater network, you can drastically extend your communication range, even across multiple ridgelines. This is a huge advantage for spirited drives in the backcountry where cell coverage is nonexistent. In addition, GMRS lower channel frequencies (Channel 1-8) overlap with FRS frequencies. This is helpful if you want to communicate within a long convoy but the other party only has their kid\u0026rsquo;s toy walkie talkies (generally FRS).\nYou do need an FCC license to operate GMRS, but there’s no exam, just a simple application and a one-time fee ($20) that covers your entire family for ten years. A top contender for my picks.\nAmateur Radio (HAM) # HAM radio is the gold standard in terms of range, clarity, and capability—but it comes with more responsibility. Unlike GMRS, HAM does require passing a test to get licensed. That said, the entry-level Technician license isn’t too hard to get, and it opens up access to a huge variety of frequencies and features.\nWith HAM, you can tap into powerful repeaters, use digital modes, and even bounce signals off satellites if you\u0026rsquo;re into that kind of thing. In terms of performance, nothing really beats it. It’s also a favorite among off-roaders and serious overlanders because of the reliability and extended reach.\nThe downside? It’s a quite bit more involved to set up, and because of the licensing and technical learning curve, it can be overkill if all you need is basic comms on a cruise.\nMy Decision # In the end, I eventually went with GMRS. I considered it the sweet spot. It’s got better range and clarity than FRS, without the baggage of CB, and doesn’t require the same level of technical knowledge as HAM. The I bought four radios total. Two Retivis RB17P hand held radios and two Retivis RA86 mobile radios. The intent was for the RA86\u0026rsquo;s to go into the S2000\u0026rsquo;s and the RB17P\u0026rsquo;s be for spotters, extras, etc. that came with us.\nRA86 S2000 Installation # Once I got them, I did a preliminary setup within my car testing functionality, range, and basic usage. Overall, it was pretty good but there was a lack of a place to put the hand held. Down the road, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to get a Modifry radio (headunit) bracket for it. It did look a little out of place splayed out out like that so I tucked the main unit under the passenger seat and routed the antenna to behind the passenger head. I placed the hand unit clipped to the sun visors but since this caused extra wear on them, I eventually took them down. Placing the antenna behind the passenger head was not a good choice; The factory rollover protection creates some sort of Faraday cage and signal wasn\u0026rsquo;t that good unless directly behind the antenna. To solve this, I decided the best place would be where the original S2000 radio antenna was. I use Bluetooth so removing it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt the functionality. In addition, it would give it a very clean look. For this, I took out the factory radio unit and measured the dimensions needed to position the antenna accordingly. I then created a mount in SolidWorks and sent the STL to a friend that access to a 3D printer at their workplace. After a long print, they dropped it off and I installed it. Along with it came a top hat that I tried to create but got the dimensions all wrong. For now, I covered the opening with some painters tape. Eventually, after the iteration of Hyperion V2, I found an OEM part (82871-671-000) that slots nicely into hole. After some power drilling and cutting. I had a nice seal with a clean look. If you would like the STL of the mount or have any questions about the process, feel free to contact me at jonathan.lo@teamspiralracing.com or reach out to contact@teamspiralracing.com.\nProgramming the Radios # As mentioned previously, one of the biggest advantages of GMRS is the ability to link off repeaters and extend range. Now the process for doing this is quite difficult (especially for beginners such as myself) so I\u0026rsquo;m going to be as detailed as I can. In general, the steps are:\nGet an FCC license to receive a GMRS callsign (and the right to operate on GMRS high power frequencies). Register for an account on myGMRS.com. Find a repeater you would like access to and request access. Wait for an email giving you approval. In it should be some private line (PL) tones that you should take note of. Purchase a programming cable and down the programming software for your GMRS radio. Program the PL tones and frequency and test. GMRS License (1) # The real GMRS license test is navigating the FCC website so I followed an extremely helpful guide on Reddit. After about two business days, I got my GMRS callsign.\nUsing myGMRS (2-4) # Using my new callsign, I signed up for myGMRS.com. Using the map, I was able to find a repeater close to me. The repeater of interest to me was one off of Palomar Mountain (PCOMM). To gain access to this repeater, you need put in a request with justification. My justification was just wanting to learn how to operate with repeaters. I submitted an access request for that repeater and couple days or weeks later, I got an email with the PL tones and their respective frequencies.\nProgramming (5-6) # I was an idiot and bough programming cables off the Retivis website even though they came in the box. Generally they look like this for the hand helds and are pretty compatible across brands of radio (Baofeng, Retivis, etc.). For the software, its generally available online for your brand. I got mine from the official Retivis website. Generally, you will need a Windows computer to run this software. For the actual programming process, you will want to be in range (but not too close). I made the mistake of being to close and got a lot of interference from the bouncing around.\nTo program, it is a bit different between brands. For mine I plugged in my Retivis RB17P, via the programing cable and turned it on. I launched the Retivis PB17P programming software and hit CTRL + R to read the current settings. Inside the email I got, it gave me some frequencies and the corresponding PL tones. I went into the programming software and adjusted the PL tones on the corresponding frequencies to the exact number mentioned. I then wrote back to the radio to save those settings. For me, after driving to Palomar Mountain, I got out my laptop and began programming each of the GMRS radios. Testing transmission on each radio was met with lots of feedback so I thought I had failed. However, after heading down after some runs I heard it pick up off the repeater and heard some folks chatting. Programming the radios was quite an inconsistent process for me. If you are having trouble, I would recommend looking on the myGMRS forums as they are provide a wealth of information.\nMy Experience with GMRS # Overall, I think GMRS is the way to go. At times, it can get spotty, especially if there is a lot of foliage or elevation but generally the transmission is loud and clear. It is a little finicky on the Retivis ones on how they handle C-CDC/T-CDC . Sometimes the beginning of your transmission gets cut off and may need to repeat yourself.\nFor some reason I\u0026rsquo;ve had better experiences with the handheld RB17P compared to the mobile RA86. Going forward, I plan to add a PTT system within the car, as well as some headset that I can plug into, similar to how race cars handle it. However, if you are cruising with each other, I\u0026rsquo;ve run into no issues. It\u0026rsquo;s proved quite helpful for a passenger to shout out that a biker is ahead. See the timestamp below for an example:\nWith all of this into consideration, I would definitely recommend GMRS for any car enthusiast looking to keep some communication.\n","date":"24 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cmdhr3dbk0001s4mwg9piys38/","section":"Posts","summary":"Communication on the Road Ever been deep in the mountains with your crew, carving through corners\u0026hellip;","title":"Radios (Walkie-talkies) for Car Enthusiast","type":"posts"},{"content":" Speed on the Horizon # My brother has always wanted an S2000 after getting mine. The high revving engine and light weight car was an unbeatable combination. At this point, my brother had already done some laps in mine at a track day so he was keen on picking up his own soon. And so, he started looking.\nOn October 15th, 2024 my brother sent me a listing for a 2006 Berlina Black S2000. It looked like a great deal but the only caveat was that it was in Missouri. After setting up a call with the owner, we checked for and found no rust. In addition, we did our due diligence and figured that this was a pretty good deal. Pretty soon, we were preparing for a trip to Michigan.\nFlying Over # I had recently graduated from college and my parents had given me a $500 Southwest Airlines gift card. I was originally planning on getting a job in the Bay Area and they had intended for it to cover my fare. However, this would instead serve as a ticket for both me and my brother to fly out of Ontario (ONT) to Las Vegas (LAS) for a quick 1 hour layover. We would then fly from Las Vegas to Tulsa (TUL) where we would meet the seller. He had taken the liberty of making the hour and half drive from Missouri to Tulsa in order to make this sale. Looking at the S2000 # After landing, we waited for about 20 minutes before he arrived. He showed us around the car and we took it for a test drive around the airport. One of the things we noticed was that the clutch was on its way out and had a pretty high bite point. We also confirmed that the CEL light was on due to catalytic convertor with my OBD2 scanner. We were pretty happy with the car but were able to negotiate the price down to 17k. After signing the paperwork, we were on our way home. We also noticed it did have a small tear in the softop. This would eventually become massive throughout our trip becoming a massive headache with all of the wind noise. We did try to patch it with duck tape but only had limited success.\nHeading Home # There was no easy way back, we had a roughly 20 hour drive under ideal conditions. Since we had two drivers, we didn\u0026rsquo;t plan on getting a place to stay at overnight and just raw dog it back to Riverside. We were getting hungry so we decided to grab some local fast food in the form of Charlie\u0026rsquo;s Chicken.\nHonestly the food wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad and it was cheap (compared to California prices). It served as good fuel for us to go on despite being on the heavier side. Speaking of fuel, it was amazing to see such cheap gas prices. We got a receipt from a Costco gas which served as a bit of a souvenir.\nAfter our fuel up, we started to begin our long drive east. After some time, we made it into Amarillo, Texas where we picked up some gas and dinner. This was the first time my brother and I had grabbed some Del Taco and found it pretty good. Although quite a bit messy, we enjoyed it and would try it again. We made a quick stop at a Rite Aid to clean up a bit and decided that it was a good time to head out.\nWe steadily made our way east throughout the evening. Due to some road closures, we had to make a couple of detours but overall conditions it was good. We were able to enjoy a sunset as it turned to night.\nGrand Canyon # Things were good until about midnight when we just crossed into New Mexico. A massive shower hit us and we had to slow to 40mph where even semi trucks were passing us. We focused on keeping the car on the road for about 30 minutes where we eventually made it out of the storm. We continued driving until about 4 AM where we pulled over to rest for a bit. At about 7 in the morning, we made it to Flagstaff, Arizona. Since it was on the way, we checked out the Grand Canyon. To get there, we headed up via the scenic Route 180. At the time it was snowing and we experienced an enjoyable drive through the winter wonderland. This was quite surprising considering we were in Arizona of all places but was quite welcome. Per usual, the Grand Canyon was a great sight to see.\nAfter our detour, we got back on the road. During lunch time, we stopped by Kingman to try Culver\u0026rsquo;s. A friend of mine had highly suggested it so we decided to give it a try. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad but I would pick In-n-Out over it any day. After our lunch, our lack of rest began piling up. You can see the exhaustion on my brother\u0026rsquo;s face in the picture. At this point, we had both done around 8 hours of driving. However, since we were close to the finish line, we decided to keep pushing.\nAfter some time, we eventually made it back into California. We still had another couple of hours to go but it was truly the final stretch. Our route had us drive through Joshua Tree National Park and past Chuckwalla Raceway. Someday, the same car we were currently in would eventually go to that track.\nAt 6PM, we had finally arrived at my brother\u0026rsquo;s place in Riverside. We had left for the airport on Saturday October 19th at 4:30 AM and had finally arrived back in Riverside at 6 PM. We had each driven 11 hours for a total of a 22 hour drive. After much adventure and exhaustion, the BBS2K had finally arrived home.\nConclusion # So, what did this trip net us? We had paid 17K for the S2000 and about 600 dollars for the flight tickets to Tulsa. I estimate about 300 dollars for food and gas heading back as well. Overall, it was a lot of Type 2 fun. The seats were worn so it was uncomfortable to sit, the softop was torn so lots of wind noise, and the clutch was rough so it was hard to drive. However, I would do this again in a heartbeat\u0026hellip;for a great deal on an S2000.\n","date":"25 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cmdg2euyp0001ky04ky55a1ic/","section":"Posts","summary":"Speed on the Horizon My brother has always wanted an S2000 after getting mine.

Ever since I had my S2000, I had always intended to track it a lot. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t really have time up to this point due to being in Europe for a business trip for 3 months. I had previously gone to this track on the CCW configuration but this time would be a CW. My brothers friends had reached out to us if we wanted to go. They already had a decently large size group so we planned on splitting up till the day of.\nLeading Up # That Thursday night, I flew back from San Jose (business trip) and began packing all of the equipment needed. Friday morning, I left for Riverside with various equipment in the S2000 including a jack, jack stands, an e-scooter, a whole bunch of miscellaneous stuff. You would be surprised by how much you can fit inside of an S2000. After arriving, I worked remotely till the end of the day. On Saturday, we made final preparations, grabbed some dinner with friends and rested well for our drive up.\nMorning # At 5:00 AM, we woke up and got ready. We headed out around 5:30 in the S2000 and the Accord. On the way, we grabbed some ice for the drinks that we were bringing up. We then traveled North until we reached Palmdale where we grabbed some McDonald\u0026rsquo;s for breakfast. By 8:00 AM we had reached Willow Springs. It was an uneventful drive up but was great to see the sun rise over the plains. Early Track # We did our driver\u0026rsquo;s meeting and had an enjoyable morning at the track. Met a lot of good friends during this time. Here are some pictures from the morning: Lunch # We started getting hungry as lunch approached and grabbed lunch at Guido\u0026rsquo;s @ The Hanger which was a sort of almost Italian style restaurant. Food was good but a heavy and a little on the pricier side. Some of the guys were in advanced group and decided to head out first. We stayed back for a little bit longer to enjoy the meal.\nAfternoon Track # The track started getting quite hot during the afternoon and times weren\u0026rsquo;t improving. We did have fun going out for some laps but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t going for PBs anymore. At this time, I had the opportunity to drive a 350 WHP FK8 CTR which was quite a surreal experience. After a warmup lap, I immediately set a 1:30.803 before it started overheating. I took it up for a slow cruise around the pits to cool it down and that was the end up that. At the end of the day, we did a line up in front of the Streets sign and took some pictures. One of them is the splash on \u0026ldquo;Our Team\u0026rdquo;. Dinner # Although we were tired, we decided to grab dinner on the way back. We went to One Bite Dumpling一口香饺子坊 which was great after a long day. On the way back to Riverside, there was a pretty nasty crash so stay safe out there. Conclusion # Overall a really fun track day trip. Probably the most enjoyable track day I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of doing and would love to go with a big group again.\n","date":"1 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cmdgenc7h0001l804f4flbto1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Planning It didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for us to plan this.
